CurrencyConverterJSF
====================

A simple concurrency converter based on Java Server Faces technologies. This was an asignment to get used with J2EE technologies for a course in KTH. We made use of the MVC (Model View Controller) Architectural pattern. We shared the workload me and my colleague Fernando Garcia Sanjuan.
